        <p>
          I'm a front-end developer on a journey that kicked off just over a
          year ago. Bachelor's degree in Sports Science, now embarking on a
          coding journey. Self-taught and committed to continuous improvement, I
          bring autonomy and problem-solving skills to development. Beyond the
          screen, my passion for film photography has shaped my approach to
          design, appreciating the nuances of layout and color schemes, much
          like framing the perfect shot. Excited to contribute and grow in a
          dynamic environment, bringing freshness and dedication to your
          projects by giving me the opportunity to collaborate and learn. Let's
          create something amazing together!
