        <p>
          I'm a coding enthusiast, deeply engrossed in front-end development and
          fueled by a love for photo and video aesthetics. Despite earning a
          Bachelor's degree in Sports Science, I've pivoted to pursue a newfound
          passion in coding. As a self-taught learner, I navigate the coding
          landscape through online courses, showcasing my autonomy and
          problem-solving skills. Committed to continuous improvement, I bring a
          fresh perspective to development. Let's infuse creativity into code!
